        <p class="intro">When planning your wedding, there are things that are nice to know, and there are things you
            need to know. <br>
            advice so essential any bride who's lucky enough to hear it thinks, "I'm so glad someone told me that!"<br>
            If you're wondering whether there's something you may have missed (or even if you've got everything under
            control), <br>
            check out our indispensable planning secrets below. <br></p>


        <section id="space"> <b>1. Guests Come First</b><br>
            Get a grip on the approximate number of guests you'll invite before settling on a venue. <br>
            This will ensure there's ample space for your crew. As a rule of thumb, allow for 25 to 30 square feet per
            guest.<br>
            That may seem like a lot, but it's really not if you count the space you'll need for the tables, bustling
            waiters, the band and a dance floor.</section>
        <section id="budget"><b>2. Check Your Credit</b><br>
            Take advantage of the high cost of weddings and sign up for a credit card with a rewards program. Whether
            it gives you airline miles or great shopping deals, consolidating all wedding-related purchases to this
            card will help you accumulate thousands of rewards points (which could be used for your honeymoon).</section>
        <section id="Organization"><b>3. Get Organizationally Focused</b><br>
            In a three-ring binder, compile all your correspondences with vendors, notes you make during meetings, and
            photos or tear sheets from magazines you want vendors to see.<br>
            Set up a special email address dedicated to your wedding, and store important vendor numbers in your cell
            phone. For on-the-go planning that keeps everything in one place, download the The Knot All-In-One Wedding
            Planner app to keep all of your planning info digitally on-hand at all times.</section>
