        <section id="Wedding-Budget"><b>Its all about the Money</b><br>
            "Expensive" and "stressful" might be two things that come to mind when you think of wedding planning, but they don't have to be.<br>
           find the budgeting mistakes you should avoid in order to make your wedding planning process as fun and cost-efficient as possible. </section>

           <section id="Location"><b>Find the perfect Location that fits your theme</b><br>
            Since a wedding day is an once-in-a-lifetime experience, you want to make everything special.  From the music to the flowers to the guests, you are building memories that will last forever.  <br>
            Included in these menus will be the venue.  There are several types to choose from.  You can go with something simple like a church or community hall. <br>
             You can select from a wide variety of catering halls or hotel ballrooms.  You can also choose a distinct wedding venue that will make your day truly special. <br>
              It can be on a beautiful landscape or in a unique building.  Whatever the setting, get the most out of your venue for you and your guests.</section>
      <br>
              <section id="Vendors"> <b>Who?  What?</b><br>
                It's no secret that planning a wedding can be exciting, overwhelming, and very expensive. Aside from paying for the big things like the venue, your dress, and rings, <br>
            you also need to write out checks for lots of vendors to really make the party stand out. The payments don't stop there, <br>
            though: you also need to tip most of the vendors, and figuring out how to go about that can be pretty confusing.</section>
