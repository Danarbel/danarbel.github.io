            <p class="intro">Not convinced a planner is for you? Here's a list of the general tasks planners can handle.</p>
   
          <ul><li>Setting up a realistic wedding budget</li>

         <li> Devising a wedding master plan that maps out all the little details, from ceremony music to favors</li>
          
          <li>Showing you the best and most original locations in the area, considering your wedding size, budget, and vision</li>
          
         <li> Finding the top florists, photographers, caterers, bands, DJs and other vendors in your price range</li>
          
          <li>Cutting you choice deals: Consultants bring volume to favored vendors, so often the vendors will reciprocate by slashing prices or throwing in extras</li>
          
          <li>Reading over all your vendor contracts to make sure everything is there, correct, and in accordance with your best interests and negotiations any amendments on your behalf</li>
          
          <li>Handling the invitations, from the wording and ordering to the addressing and mailing, as well as tracking RSVPs</li>
          
          <li>Counseling you on proper etiquette as well as what's hot on the wedding front</li>
          
          <li>Managing the wedding day: supervising vendors, setup, and delivery; handling emergencies; and soothing nerves</li>
          
          <li>Serving as your spokesperson, conveying your every whim and desire to vendors or family members when you just can't deal with doing it yourself</li>
          
          
          </ul>
