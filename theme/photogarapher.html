        <p class="intro">Unlike the work of your other wedding vendors (music, flower arrangements, cake), photographs
            aren't things you can hear, smell, taste or even see at first—you don't really know what you're getting
            until after the fact.<br>

            That means careful research and selectiveness regarding professional skills, artistic style and personal
            demeanor are extra important when choosing your photographer.</p>
        <section id="style"><b>Step 1: Settle on a Style</b><br>
            Before you begin researching photographers, you'll need to first decide what type of photography style you
            prefer, as that will help determine which kind of photographer you'll want shooting your wedding. Get
            inspired! <br>
            Spend time pouring over any kind of imagery you love, from décor shots to a fashion blogger's Instagram
            feed. <br>
            Once you have a good collection of inspiring photographs, try to narrow in on what draws you to them
            specifically and dissect what feels most authentic to you and your partner.<br>
            Maybe that's formal-posed portraits, a classic photography style or a lifestyle, photojournalistic feel. If
            you love sharp and contrast-y shots, perhaps a photographer with a flair for the dramatic is the right
            choice for you. <br>
            Remember that you don't necessarily need to narrow in on one style in particular, since many wedding
            photographers can do a blend of portraiture and documentary-style shots, a mix of black-and-white and color
            images and so on. But if there's a special style you love, make sure to focus on photographers who
            specialize in it.

        </section>
        <section id="homework"><b>Step 2: Do Your Homework</b><br>
            Start your search by reading reviews from recent newlyweds and browsing local listings.<br>
            Carefully review potential photographers' websites and blogs to check out photos of other weddings they've
            shot, which will give you an idea of their style. <br>
            How do they capture the moments important to you, like a mother bustling her daughter's gown or an
            emotional first look? The design of the website may also have clues about the photographer's personality
            and sensibility.<br>
            Check out their Facebook, Instagram and Twitter pages too, if possible. Is the feedback from clients
            positive? How does the photographer respond? How do they interact with their Instagram followers, do they
            seem friendly and personable? You get the idea.

        </section>
        <section id="connection"><b>Step 3: Make Sure Your Personalities Mesh</b><br>
            Don't underestimate the importance of liking and bonding with your photographer. Is the photographer
            excited by your vision when you describe it? <br>
            When they make suggestions, do they present them in a clear and respectful way, or are they timid? Are
            their mannerisms off-putting? In order to get the best photos, go with a pro who has a firm grasp of social
            graces but is bold enough to go out hunting for great images and who, above all, puts you at ease and
            doesn't irritate you in any way.<br>
            Remember: They'll be shadowing your every move, and the more comfortable both of you are with the
            photographer, the better the photos will turn out. Likewise, you don't want the photographer to offend or
            annoy any guests, but to shoot them in their best light in an unobtrusive way.<br>
            To get the best photos, your photographer needs to be assertive enough to seek out great moments, cajoling
            enough to coax relaxed smiles and natural stances from guests, and calm enough to be a positive force. They
            should ask lots of questions and be a good listener.
