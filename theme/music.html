There’s a lot to consider when picking your wedding music: the flow of the day; key moments you want to highlight; meaningful songs for special dances and tunes you definitely don’t want to hear.

            Unless you already know “your song,” this will probably be the toughest music-related decision you make. Start by thinking about the kind of dance you want to have: is it intimate and cheek-to-cheek, or is it fun, silly or choreographed?<br>
             Do you want to surprise your guests, or bring them to tears? You could also choose a song that’s meaningful for one of your families, perhaps your grandparents’ first dance song. Whatever you decide, just make sure you’ll be comfortable when you’re out there together on the dance floor.<br>
              Note that you can also move your first dance to the end of dinner and use it to kick off the dance party, or share your dance between courses, while guests are waiting for their next dishes. Check out these first dance song ideas if you’re struggling to find a tune that you love.

            Of course, “Here Comes the Bride” (which is actually Wagner’s “Bridal Chorus”) and Pachelbel’s “Canon in D” are the go-tos here, <br>
            but if you’d rather enter to another song you know and love, go for it! You could even surprise everyone at your wedding with a down-the-aisle dance!

            Here’s your chance to tell the DJ or band which songs you need to hear at your wedding, and which tunes they absolutely cannot play (yes, do-not-play lists are totally allowed!) <br>
            If music is especially important to you and your spouse-to-be, make sure you hammer out all the must-haves and songs associated with special moments in your relationship.<br>
             You should also let your band or DJ have some free reign to play the hits they know will get your guests moving.
