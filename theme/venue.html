                Before you get to the aesthetics of a location, it is a good idea to make a check list of what practical needs you are going to need.  <br>
                Putting practicality before romance may not sound like something you want to do for a perfect wedding, but it will mean that you are not spending your wedding day fretting over things that could have been settled months before.<br>

                Start out with all the essentials.  Get a headcount of your guests.   Are you having the wedding on the premises or at a church?  Are you going to serve liquor or not?  Are you planning just appetizers or a full meal? <br>
                 Will it be sit down or buffet?  Are you going to have a DJ or a live band?   Are there guests that will need special services such as handicap access?  These are all the things that you need to sort out before you choose the venue.

                Destination weddings have become popular in recent years.  Couples choose a site and guest all travel there to enjoy the special day.  It is a beautiful way to enjoy this special, although it can be expensive for guests.  <br>
                Much as everyone wants a one-of-kind affair, keep that in mind when choosing a venue.<br>

                Let us take a quick trip back to reality so that you can walk that fine line between what you want and what works.  You want to make sure that any of these facilities have the practical items that were listed above. <br>
                 You also want to make sure that it will be accommodating for your guests. For example, if it is a beautiful but inaccessible view and many of your guests are elderly, you may want to consider that.  You also should consider the weather. <br>
                  Do not pick a venue that is great in spring but gets really sticky in mid-summer.

            <section id="What to Look For"><b>What to Look For?</b><br>
                If you have decided to choose a scenic wedding, great.  Think of all things that you want to have.  Start with the site.  A spacious landscape is a wonderful way for you and your guest to enjoy your day.  A site that brings all the beauty that Mother Nature can supply in flora and fauna. <br>
                 Still, itâ€™s not just Mother Nature, you can also get a beautiful or historic building.  All of this will make a great background for your wedding photos.<br>
                <br>
                If you want to pay for a full venue you should put together a checklist.  It should have a beautiful view where guests can feel comfortable. <br>
                 It should have a place on site for the wedding that will be ideal for a romantic start to your life together.   Perhaps a gazebo that the couple can exchange vows on. <br>
                  You will want plenty of room for guests to dance the night away.  You will also want plenty of room for guests to relax away from the dance floor.  After all, the choice of music for the young crowd may not work for the older folk.<br>

                So, pick a venue that is as majestic as your dreams.  Pick one that your guests will remember forever, with beautiful views that will make for great photos.  The romance will flow and the guest will share in your joy. <br>
                 It is a once in a lifetime event that should be treated as such.
